FFZ addon for assigning badges to users locally.

# Features

- Client-side badges

- No seriously, that's it

## Installation:

[You can get the userscript from here.](https://darkrta.github.io/LocalBadges/localbadges.user.js) 

I have no plans to make this a browser extension so you'll have to use 
Tampermonkey or equivalent.

I also have no plans to have this added to FFZ add-ons repo.

# Bugs:

* Usernames must be entered in all lowercase.

* There is very little checking for if a badge is valid.

* This outright abuses ffz's badge handling which may result in some strange.
  issues

* There is almost no documentation.
