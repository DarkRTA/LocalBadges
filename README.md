FFZ addon for assigning badges to users locally.

# Features

- Clientside badges

- No seriously, that's it

## Installation:

[You can get the userscript from here.](https://theessenceofdarkness.github.io/LocalBadges/localbadges.user.js) 

I have no plans to make this a browser extension so you'll have to use tampermonkey or equivilant.
