FFZ addon for assigning badges to users locally.

# **BIG NOTE**

This does not work properly with ffz's profiles. Do not bug me or FFZ 
developers about this. I will fix this when I get the chance to.

# Features

- Clientside badges

- No seriously, that's it

## Installation:

[You can get the userscript from here.](https://theessenceofdarkness.github.io/LocalBadges/localbadges.user.js) 

I have no plans to make this a browser extension so you'll have to use tampermonkey or equivilant.
